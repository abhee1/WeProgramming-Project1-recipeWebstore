	<h3> Introduction</h3>
	<p> <span>Chicken Pizza</span> is a dish of <span>Italian</span> origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened <span>wheat-based dough</span> topped with tomatoes, cheese, Chicken and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a <span>wood-fired oven</span>.

	Pizza and its variants are among the <span>most popular foods</span> in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food. In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
