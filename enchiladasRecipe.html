	<h3> Directions </h3>
	<p>1. <b>Filling Preparation</b>: Cook and season the filling ingredients, whether it's meat, beans, or vegetables. Common seasonings include cumin, chili powder, and garlic.

	  <br> 2. <b>Sauce Preparation </b>: Prepare the sauce by blending or simmering the desired ingredients. Red enchilada sauce is typically made from dried red chilies, while green enchilada sauce is made from green chilies.

		<br>3. <b>Assembling the Enchiladas </b>: Heat the tortillas briefly to make them pliable. Place a portion of the filling down the center of each tortilla and roll it up, placing them seam side down in a baking dish.

		<br>4. <b>Sauce and Cheese </b>: Pour the sauce generously over the rolled tortillas. Sprinkle cheese over the top. The cheese can melt and become slightly crispy during baking.

		<br>5. <b>Baking</b>: Bake the enchiladas in the oven until the cheese is melted, and the enchiladas are heated through, typically around 15-20 minutes at 350°F (175°C).

		<br>6. <b>Toppings</b>: Once out of the oven, garnish your enchiladas with your choice of toppings, such as sour cream, chopped onions, fresh cilantro, or slices of ripe avocado.
