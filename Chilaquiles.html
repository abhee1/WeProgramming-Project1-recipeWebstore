	<h3> Introduction:</h3>
	<p> <span>Chilaquiles</span> is a traditional Mexican dish featuring fried or baked tortilla chips topped with a variety of sauces and toppings, known for its delightful mix of flavors and textures. It is often enjoyed for breakfast or brunch.

Chilaquiles have ancient roots in Mesoamerican cuisine, initially devised as a way to repurpose stale tortillas. Spanish influence introduced new ingredients, and regional variations have since emerged. Modern chilaquiles can be found throughout Mexico and worldwide, with a wide array of toppings and sauces.

	<h3> Directions </h3>
	<p>1. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry tortillas and onion in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, stirring frequently. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Drain the skillet, leaving only a thin residue of oil.

	  <br> 2. Place the skillet over medium heat. Return fried tortillas and onion to the skillet and stir in beaten eggs; season with salt. Cook and stir until eggs are firm.

	  <br>3. Stir in tomato sauce and water. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese and continue cooking until cheese is melted.
