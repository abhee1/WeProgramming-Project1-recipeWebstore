	<h3> Introduction</h3>
	<p> <span>Tiramisu</span> is a <span>coffee-flavoured</span> Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar and mascarpone, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts. Its origin is disputed between the Italian regions of <span>Veneto</span> and <span>Friuli Venezia Giulia</span>.

	The original shape of the cake is round, although the shape of the biscuits also allows the use of a rectangular or square pan. However, it is often assembled in round glasses, which show the various layers, or pyramid. Modern versions can have the addition of whipped cream or whipped egg, or both, combined with mascarpone cream. This makes the dish lighter, thick and foamy. Among the most common alcoholic changes includes the addition of Marsala wine. The cake is usually eaten <span>cold</span>.

	Another variation involves the preparation of the <span>cream with eggs</span> heated to sterilize it, but not so much that the eggs scramble. Over time, replacing some of the ingredients, mainly coffee, there arose numerous variants such as tiramisu with chocolate, amaretto, berry, lemon, strawberry, pineapple, yogurt, banana, raspberry, and coconut.

	<h3> Directions </h3>
	<p><li>Using an electric mixer in a large bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume.</li>

	  <br><li>A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Set aside.</li>

		<br><li>In a medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft peaks. </li>

		<br><li>Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. </li>

		<br><li>Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>

		<br><li>For the assembly, combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>

		<br><li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</li>

		<br><li>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.).</li>

		<br><li>Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</li>

		<br><li>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder.</li>
		
		<br><li>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better). Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired, then slice or scoop to serve.</li></p>
