	<p>

	<li>
	  In a spacious bowl, blend 2 cups of wheat flour with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, ensuring thorough mixing.
	  </li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Gradually add water as necessary, initiating the kneading process.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Incorporate 2 tablespoons of oil into the mixture and knead it diligently until the dough achieves a smooth and soft texture.

	<br>
	<li>

	<h3> Aloo Stuffing for Paratha</h3>
	<li>

	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Add 3 potatoes, 1 teaspoon of ginger paste, 2 chili peppers, 2 tablespoons of coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon of coriander seeds to the bowl.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Also, include 1/4 teaspoon of ajwain, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder, 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala, 3/4 teaspoon of aamchur (mango powder), and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the bowl.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Thoroughly mix all these ingredients, ensuring they are well combined to create the aloo stuffing.

	<h3>Making Aloo Paratha</h3>
	<li>
		After letting the dough rest for 20 minutes, give it a slight knead.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Pinch a portion of the dough to form a ball, and roll it out to about 4 inches in diameter.Place a ball-sized serving of the prepared aloo stuffing in the center of the rolled-out dough.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Begin pleating the edges of the dough, folding them toward the center, and then securely pinch off any excess dough.Sprinkle a bit of wheat flour on the dough and roll it slightly thicker.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	On a hot tawa (griddle), position the rolled paratha and cook for approximately one minute.After the base is partially cooked (about a minute), flip the paratha.
