	<h3> Introduction</h3>
	<p>Sambar rice, often referred to as <span>"Sambhar Sadam"</span> in South India, is a delicious and comforting one-pot meal that combines sambar (a spicy and tangy lentil-based stew) with rice. 
	It's a popular and wholesome dish that's a staple in <span>South Indian cuisine</span>.
	Sambar itself has its roots in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, with historical influences from various cultures and regions.
	It's a <span>spicy and tangy lentil-based stew</span> that is thought to have been developed during the reign of the <span>Maratha ruler Shahuji</span> in the 17th century. 
	The dish further evolved with the influence of the <span>Tanjore Marathas and the Maratha ruler Sambhaji</span>, which is said to be the origin of the name "sambar."

	<h3> Directions </h3>
	<p>
	<li>
	  In a pan, heat a teaspoon of ghee and add all the spice ingredients except for the coconut. Sauté the spices on low heat until they become fragrant. Then, introduce the coconut and continue sautéing until the coconut takes on a slight golden hue. Allow the mixture to cool.
		Next, grind the roasted spices into a smooth paste, using about half a cup of water. Set the paste aside for later use.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Immerse a tamarind piece approximately the size of a gooseberry in a cup of water and let it soak for 15 minutes. Afterward, gently squeeze the tamarind to extract its pulp, strain the pulp, and keep it aside for later use.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Combine the vegetables, along with the onion, tomato, and tamarind pulp, in a pressure cooker. Allow the vegetables to cook in the cooker, giving them 2 whistles (approximately 5-6 minutes of cooking time).
		Once done, remove the cooker from the heat and patiently wait for the pressure inside to release naturally. You can choose your preferred vegetables, such as carrots, beans, chow-chow, drumstick, etc., totaling 2 cups of vegetables.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Now, it's time to prepare the rice and dal. Begin by soaking the dal and rice in water for half an hour. We'll be using raw rice for this particular recipe.

It's important to note that we're using an equal quantity of dal and rice. For instance, take half a cup each of toor dal and sona masuri rice.

Using a pressure cooker, cook the dal and rice with 3 cups of water until you hear 5 whistles. Remove the cooker from the stove and allow the pressure to release naturally.

Once the cooker can be safely opened, use the back of a ladle to mash the rice and dal. Set this mixture aside for further use.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Now, it's time for the final tempering and assembly.

Begin by heating oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, red chilies, and curry leaves to the hot oil. Allow the seeds to splutter and release their aroma.

Then, introduce half a cup of water and the ground masala to the pan. Add asafoetida (hing), turmeric powder, and salt to the mixture. Let it simmer for about a minute, allowing the flavors to meld together.
</li>
	<li>
		Incorporate the boiled vegetable mixture into the pan. Allow it to simmer for an additional 5 minutes.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Now, introduce the cooked mixture of dal and rice and blend it thoroughly. Also, add the ghee to the mixture. You'll notice that the rice mixture will initially have a slightly liquid consistency, but as it cools, it will naturally thicken.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Remove the mixture from the heat source and let it cool for a minimum of 30 minutes before serving.
	</li>
