	<h3> Introduction:</h3>
	<p> <span>Conchas</span> or "pan de concha," are iconic Mexican sweet bread pastries with a distinctive seashell-like sugar crust topping. They are a beloved part of Mexican cuisine, enjoyed for breakfast or as a sweet snack. Conchas have their roots in the colonial period, influenced by European and indigenous culinary traditions. Over time, they have become a symbol of Mexican culinary heritage and are popular both in Mexico and among Mexican communities worldwide, as well as in countries with Mexican populations. Classic flavors include vanilla and chocolate, reflecting the rich and diverse history of Mexican baking.

	<h3> Directions </h3>
	<p>1. In a large bowl, mix sugar, yeast, salt, cinnamon and 2 cups flour. In a small saucepan, heat milk and butter to 120°-130°. Add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes on medium speed. Add eggs; beat on high 2 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough (dough will be sticky).

	  <br> 2. Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

	  <br>3. Meanwhile, to make streusel, in a large bowl, beat butter, flour, sugar and vanilla until combined. Divide in half. Mix chocolate into 1 half; set aside.
	  <br>4. Punch down dough. Divide dough into 12 portions; form each into a 3-in. oval. Place 2 in. apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. In a small bowl, whisk egg with milk; brush over dough. Divide plain streusel into 6 portions; roll each into a 3-in. circle. Place over half the rolls. Repeat with chocolate streusel and remaining rolls. Using a sharp knife, cut through streusel on top of rolls to resemble a clamshell.
	  <br> 5. Cover with kitchen towels; let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°. Brush rolls with remaining egg wash. Bake until tops are lightly browned, 15-20 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
